# DP Network Experiment

This repository contains an experiment using Differential Privacy (DP) with the Opacus library on the UNSW-NB15 network security dataset.

This notebook compares the performance of a baseline model and a differentially private model using PyTorch.

## Contents

- Data preprocessing (SMOTE, normalization)
- Model training (Baseline and DP)
- Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix)
- Epsilon (Îµ) calculation using Opacus
